    ---
    Context:
    {context}
    ---

    Question:
    {question}

    ---
    Guidelines:
    - Use ONLY the information from the context to answer.
    - Provide a **detailed, well-structured explanation**.
    - Include clarifications, reasoning, or examples if they are explicitly supported by the context.
    - If multiple relevant points exist, summarize them in an organized way (bullets or short paragraphs).
    - Avoid generic phrases or short answers unless the context truly contains only one fact.
    - If the context does not include sufficient data to answer confidently, respond clearly with:
      "The provided documents do not include enough information to answer this question."

    Style:
    - Professional, informative, and precise tone.
    - Write in full sentences with clarity and completeness.
    - If the question asks for a process, explain each step mentioned in the documents.
    - If the question involves definitions or rules, provide the full explanation from the text.
